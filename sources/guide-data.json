It starts with a doozy of a bun, baked on the premises and enriched with milk. The patty? An all-chuck formula (sourced from Peterson Limousin Beef in Osceola, Wis.) that gets an overnight cure before being fortified with butter, formed into thick-ish patties and nurtured in its own juices on the flat top grill to an ideal medium, bordering on medium-well. Cheese is American, two extravagant slices, and the pickles are superb. Finishing touches? A pair of sauces. It’s a classic.</p>\n","name":"Esker Grove","mainImage":[{"id":"attYUchf3mlqTDmdR","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/WzraO0njQoOYPHrmB8Ib_sanguinic_1494601762_esker.JPG","filename":"sanguinic_1494601762_esker.JPG","size":55457,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/lWuLtYCWR0yKXSL7KWY3_small_sanguinic_1494601762_esker.JPG","width":54,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/rbagg0xcTpqUI0ndsrzh_large_sanguinic_1494601762_esker.JPG","width":630,"height":420}}}],"price":3,"id":"burger-esker-grove","website":"http://eskergrove.com/","airtableId":"rec1Zh9Lhv4c8kTWL"},{"imageCredit":"Photo by AP / First Last","lists":["recNeE4L92h5Io7pQ"],"phone":"(555) 555-5555","neighborhood":"Should be dropdown?","address":"123 Way St, Mineapolis, MN 55111","description":"<p>This is an example description.

And, wow. Sprague follows the double-patty formula, but not blindly; the sirloin-heavy patties are noticeably hefty (the meat also hails from Peterson Limousin Beef), and the condiments are restrained: shredded iceberg lettuce, the kitchen’s crunchy bread-and-butter pickles, a few slices of American cheese that gets a smoked Gouda boost, and a rich, umami-laced Russian dressing-like sauce. The house-baked brioche bun is nothing short of perfect. Remember, it’s available Thursdays only, after 7 p.m., in the cafe.</p>\n","name":"Cafe Alma","mainImage":[{"id":"attlivaAwHw6B64DR","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/cJRJibKRJu5FTBcD2KnN_sanguinic_1494601786_alma.JPG","filename":"sanguinic_1494601786_alma.JPG","size":105901,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/uW0409ETTCOuXdqzlnBw_small_sanguinic_1494601786_alma.JPG","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/ZsEzoH6FTvS2cD42ZScG_large_sanguinic_1494601786_alma.JPG","width":630,"height":473}}}],"price":3,"id":"burger-cafe-alma","website":"https://www.almampls.com/cafe/","airtableId":"recVWKH6J5WMYsGt2"},{"lists":["recUKjVzwKbNvyNgX"],"phone":"(612) 252-7000","address":"901 Hennepin Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55403","description":"<p>Another single-patty format that just might turn the tide on the popularity of the double-patty burger. The beef is exceptional, an in-house grind that’s a Neiman Marcus-like mix of Niman Ranch prime chuck and brisket, fortified by a few secret weapons: trims from the menu’s tenderloin, New York strip and sirloin steaks. Simple and effective garnishes (including a ketchup-free sauce that adds zing but doesn’t overwhelm) ring true to its “Old School Cheeseburger” name, and the buttery, challah-style bun is first-rate.</p>\n","name":"Mercy","mainImage":[{"id":"attdnOBp7lMk1PhmR","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/7HANGoENTS2LMAQUHUG8_sanguinic_1494601810_mercy.JPG","filename":"sanguinic_1494601810_mercy.JPG","size":128620,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/E7EXnEVzSmm35WBgl7Rd_small_sanguinic_1494601810_mercy.JPG","width":48,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/q50w44Q2WLSjwjWIgQfA_large_sanguinic_1494601810_mercy.JPG","width":630,"height":473}}}],"price":4,"id":"burger-mercy","website":"http://mercympls.com/","airtableId":"recmPl2wOOc87jF5R"}]}
