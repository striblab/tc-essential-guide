At 5.6 million square feet, there’s room for every kind of store, restaurant and kids’ activity, making the 25-year-old mall a customizable — and fully heated — experience.</p>\n<p>Like a town square, the mall is laid out in four, three-level lanes around a full-fledged, indoor amusement park, <a href=\"nickelodeonuniverse.com\">Nickelodeon Universe</a>, complete with roller coasters and a log flume. The first level of South Avenue has several high-end shops, like Henri Bendel, Stuart Weitzman and Burberry. East Broadway’s first level is for sports fans: <a href=\"goldyslockerroom.com\">Hockey Minnesota</a> has Wild and Gophers paraphernalia, and the <a href=\"vikingsfanshop.com\">Vikings Locker Room</a> is your shop for Super Bowl LII tees and pennants. </p>\n<p>The third level of West Market includes Minnesota-themed shops for purchasing a stuffed moose or Minnetonka moccasins. And Rybicki (952-854-3330, rybickicheese4u.com), a shop devoted to our neighboring state, stocks Packers gear and foam cheese heads, and ample samples of cheddar. Head over to Old Vine Wine and Spirits to buy a bottle from local distilleries and you’ll have the makings of your own happy hour (952-858-8800, facebook.com/OldVineWineSpirits). </p>\n<p>Some unique mall finds include: Faribault Woolen Mills (1-888-850-1865, faribaultmill.com), with blankets from the Minnesota-based legacy company; Greater Good (612-524-6830, greatergood.com), a crafts and trinkets shop that benefits charities for breast cancer, literacy and more; and Five Below (952-854-5340, fivebelow.com), for discount-seekers. </p>\n<p>If you’re looking to kill time or distract children, the mall’s got you covered. Mini-golf, maze games and escape rooms abound on the third floor, and a smaller fourth level houses a comedy club and virtual reality arcade. Sea Life Aquarium (952-883-0202, visitsealife.com) gives guests hands-on access to starfish and other creatures in a touch tank. Crayola Experience (952-851-5800, crayolaexperience.com) lets kids draw on the walls. </p>\n<p>It doesn’t take much work to find whatever Mall of America experience you are looking for.

Most eateries are concentrated on the third floor. Try local hot spots such as the authentic Japanese Masu (952-896-6278, masusushiandrobata.com), Crave (952-854-5000, craveamerica.com) or Middle Eastern Naf Naf Grill (952-232-5774, nafnafgrill.com).

The first level of South Avenue has several high-end shops, like Henri Bendel, Stuart Weitzman and Burberry. East Broadway’s first level is for sports fans: <a href=\"goldyslockerroom.com\">Hockey Minnesota</a> has Wild and Gophers paraphernalia, and the <a href=\"vikingsfanshop.com\">Vikings Locker Room</a> is your shop for Super Bowl LII tees and pennants. </p>\n<p>The third level of West Market includes Minnesota-themed shops for purchasing a stuffed moose or Minnetonka moccasins. And Rybicki (952-854-3330, rybickicheese4u.com), a shop devoted to our neighboring state, stocks Packers gear and foam cheese heads, and ample samples of cheddar. Head over to Old Vine Wine and Spirits to buy a bottle from local distilleries and you’ll have the makings of your own happy hour (952-858-8800, facebook.com/OldVineWineSpirits). </p>\n<p>Some unique mall finds include: Faribault Woolen Mills (1-888-850-1865, faribaultmill.com), with blankets from the Minnesota-based legacy company; Greater Good (612-524-6830, greatergood.com), a crafts and trinkets shop that benefits charities for breast cancer, literacy and more; and Five Below (952-854-5340, fivebelow.com), for discount-seekers. </p>\n<p>If you’re looking to kill time or distract children, the mall’s got you covered. Mini-golf, maze games and escape rooms abound on the third floor, and a smaller fourth level houses a comedy club and virtual reality arcade. Sea Life Aquarium (952-883-0202, visitsealife.com) gives guests hands-on access to starfish and other creatures in a touch tank. Crayola Experience (952-851-5800, crayolaexperience.com) lets kids draw on the walls. </p>\n<p>It doesn’t take much work to find whatever Mall of America experience you are looking for.
